- Operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for performing arithmetic operations.
- Special function buttons for square, square root, percentage, one divided by x, and factorial calculations.
- Clear buttons for clearing the current value or all values.
- Equals button (=) to compute and display the result.
- Error handling for invalid expressions and division by zero.
